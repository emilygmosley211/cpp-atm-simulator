# cpp-atm-simulator
Welcome to my ATM Simulation.
This is a simple ATM simulator written in C++ that allows users to interact with an account and perform basic banking operations. The program supports:

Checking the current balance

Depositing money into the account

Withdrawing money from the account

Exiting the application

The program features input validation, ensuring that users cannot perform invalid operations, such as depositing negative amounts or overdrawing the account.
